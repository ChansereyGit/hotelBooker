## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No hotels found
**Solution**: 
- Check backend is running
- Verify mock data is loaded
- Check search location matches data in database
- Look at backend logs for errors

### Issue: No rooms displayed
**Solution**:
- Check `GET /api/hotels/{id}/rooms` endpoint
- Verify rooms exist for the hotel in database
- Check backend logs for errors

### Issue: Booking fails
**Solution**:
- Check user is logged in (JWT token valid)
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Check backend logs for validation errors
- Ensure database constraints are met

### Issue: App crashes on navigation
**Solution**:
- Check Flutter console for errors
- Verify all required arguments are passed
- Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- Restart the app

## API Endpoints to Monitor

While testing, you can monitor these API calls in backend logs:

```
POST /api/hotels/search          â†’ Search hotels
GET  /api/hotels/{id}            â†’ Get hotel details
GET  /api/hotels/{id}/rooms      â†’ Get available rooms
POST /api/bookings               â†’ Create booking
GET  /api/bookings               â†’ Get user bookings
```

## Backend Logs to Watch

```bash
# In backend directory
tail -f logs/application.log

# Look for:
# - Incoming requests
# - SQL queries
# - Response status codes
# - Any errors or exceptions
```

## Database Queries for Verification

```sql
-- Check hotels
SELECT id, name, city FROM hotels;

-- Check rooms for a hotel
SELECT id, room_type, price_per_night, available_rooms 
FROM rooms 
WHERE hotel_id = 1;

-- Check bookings
SELECT id, hotel_name, room_type, check_in_date, check_out_date, status 
FROM bookings 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check user
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE email = 'john.doe@example.com';
```

## Performance Testing

### Load Time Expectations
- Hotel search: < 1 second
- Hotel detail load: < 500ms
- Room list load: < 500ms
- Booking submission: < 2 seconds

### Memory Usage
- App should not exceed 200MB RAM
- No memory leaks on navigation
- Images should load progressively

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **If everything works:**

   - Test with different scenarios
   - Try different hotels and rooms
   - Test with multiple users

2. **If issues found:**
   - Check the error messages
   - Review backend logs
   - Verify database state
