## 📝 Key Implementation Details

### Navigation Arguments Pattern
```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(
  context,
  '/next-screen',
  arguments: {
    'key1': value1,
    'key2': value2,
  },
);

// In next screen:
final args = ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments as Map?;
final value1 = args?['key1'];
```

### Price Calculation
```dart
// Room selection
totalPrice = room.pricePerNight × nights × numberOfRooms

// Checkout
roomRate = totalPrice
taxesFees = roomRate × 0.15
finalTotal = roomRate + taxesFees
```

### Error Handling
```dart
try {
  final result = await service.method();
  if (result['success']) {
    // Handle success
  } else {
    _showErrorToast(result['message']);
  }
} catch (e) {
  _showErrorToast('Error: ${e.toString()}');
}
```
