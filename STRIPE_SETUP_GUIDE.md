# Stripe Setup Guide - Quick Start

## Step 1: Create Stripe Account (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Sign Up
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. Enter your email
3. Create a password
4. Verify your email

### 1.2 Skip Business Details (for testing)
- You can skip business verification for test mode
- Click "Skip for now" or "I'll do this later"

## Step 2: Get Your API Keys (2 minutes)

### 2.1 Access Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Make sure you're in **TEST MODE** (toggle in top right)

### 2.2 Copy Your Keys
You'll see two keys:

**Publishable Key** (Safe to share, used in Flutter):
```
pk_test_51Abc123...xyz
```

**Secret Key** (Keep private, used in Backend):
```
sk_test_51Abc123...xyz
```

Click "Reveal test key" to see the secret key.

## Step 3: What to Provide Me

Just send me these two keys (you can paste them here):

```
Publishable Key: pk_test_...
Secret Key: sk_test_...
```

**Note**: These are TEST keys, not real money involved!

## Step 4: Optional - Webhook Setup (I'll do this)

For webhook testing, we'll need:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/webhooks/stripe`
4. Events: Select "payment_intent.succeeded" and "payment_intent.payment_failed"
5. Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_...`)

But we can do this later - not required for initial testing!

## What Happens Next?

Once you provide the keys, I will:

### Backend (Spring Boot):
1. âœ… Add Stripe Java SDK dependency
2. âœ… Create Payment entity and repository
3. âœ… Create PaymentService for Stripe operations
4. âœ… Create PaymentController with endpoints
5. âœ… Update BookingService to handle payments
6. âœ… Add webhook handler for payment events
7. âœ… Configure Stripe API key

### Flutter:
1. âœ… Add flutter_stripe package
2. âœ… Initialize Stripe with publishable key
3. âœ… Create PaymentService
4. âœ… Update checkout UI with real card input
5. âœ… Implement payment confirmation
6. âœ… Handle success/failure states
7. âœ… Update booking flow

### Documentation:
1. âœ… Testing guide with test cards
2. âœ… API documentation
3. âœ… Demo script for professor
4. âœ… Troubleshooting guide

## Test Cards I'll Provide

You'll be able to test with these cards:

| Card Number | Scenario |
|-------------|----------|
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Success |
| 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Card Declined |
| 4000 0025 0000 3155 | 3D Secure Required |
| 4000 0000 0000 9995 | Insufficient Funds |

**Expiry**: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
**CVC**: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
**ZIP**: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)

## Security Notes

âœ… **Test keys are safe** - No real money
âœ… **Secret key stays in backend** - Never in Flutter
âœ… **Publishable key is public** - Safe in Flutter
âœ… **All transactions are test** - Can't charge real cards

## Quick FAQ

**Q: Do I need to add a bank account?**
A: No! Test mode works without any bank details.

**Q: Will this cost money?**
A: No! Test mode is completely free.

**Q: Can I use this for the course demo?**
A: Yes! Perfect for demonstrating real payment flow.

**Q: What if I don't have the keys yet?**
A: Just create the account (takes 5 min) and get the keys from the dashboard.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: The code will be production-ready, but you'd need to:
- Activate your Stripe account
- Switch to live keys
- Use HTTPS
- Complete business verification

## Ready?

Just paste your two keys here:
```
Publishable Key: pk_test_...
Secret Key: sk_test_...
```

And I'll implement the complete Stripe integration! ðŸŽ‰

## Alternative: Use My Test Keys (Temporary)

If you want to see it working first before creating your account, I can use placeholder keys for the initial implementation, and you can replace them later. But I recommend getting your own keys so you can:
- See transactions in your dashboard
- Test webhooks
- Have full control
- Show professor your own Stripe dashboard

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! ðŸš€
