# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## What We Just Built

Your **Spring Boot backend** is now complete with:
- ✅ User authentication (register/login with JWT)
- ✅ Hotel search with filters
- ✅ Room management
- ✅ Booking system
- ✅ Clean modular architecture

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Start the Backend (5 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies (macOS)
brew install postgresql@14 redis maven

# Start services
brew services start postgresql@14
brew services start redis

# Create database
createdb hotelbooker

# Run backend
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Expected output:**
```
Started HotelBookingApplication in 3.5 seconds
```

### 2. Test the Backend (2 minutes)

```bash
# Test registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fullName": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'

# You should get a response with accessToken
```

### 3. Integrate with Flutter (30 minutes)

Follow the guide: `backend/FLUTTER_INTEGRATION.md`

**Quick steps:**
1. Create `lib/services/api_service.dart`
2. Create `lib/services/auth_service.dart`
3. Create `lib/models/user.dart`
4. Update your login screen to call the API

### 4. Test End-to-End (10 minutes)

1. Run Flutter app
2. Try registering a new user
3. Try logging in
4. Navigate to hotel search

## 📚 Documentation Guide

### For Setup & Running
- **`backend/SETUP.md`** - Quick setup instructions
- **`backend/README.md`** - Complete backend documentation

### For Flutter Integration
- **`backend/FLUTTER_INTEGRATION.md`** - Step-by-step Flutter integration
- Includes code examples for all services

### For Understanding Architecture
- **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`** - Complete project overview
- **`ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`** - Visual architecture diagrams
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`** - Track your progress

## 🎓 Architecture Decision

We chose **Modular Monolith** because:

✅ **Simple deployment** - One application, easy to run
✅ **Fast development** - No microservices complexity
✅ **Clear structure** - Modules are well-organized
✅ **Easy to learn** - Perfect for academic projects
✅ **Cost-effective** - ~$30-50/month hosting
✅ **Scalable** - Can migrate to microservices later

## 🔑 Key Endpoints

### Authentication (Public)
```
POST /api/v1/auth/register
POST /api/v1/auth/login
```

### Hotels (Public)
```
POST /api/v1/hotels/search
GET  /api/v1/hotels/{id}
GET  /api/v1/hotels/{id}/rooms
GET  /api/v1/hotels/featured
```

### Bookings (Requires JWT Token)
```
POST /api/v1/bookings
GET  /api/v1/bookings
GET  /api/v1/bookings/upcoming
POST /api/v1/bookings/{id}/cancel
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Postman** - Test APIs before integrating with Flutter
2. **Check logs** - All errors are logged in the console
3. **Read error messages** - They're designed to be helpful
4. **Start simple** - Get login working first, then add features
5. **Ask for help** - Check the documentation files

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Connection refused"
```bash
# PostgreSQL not running
brew services start postgresql@14
```

### "Port 8080 already in use"
```bash
# Kill the process
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
```

### "Database does not exist"
```bash
# Create the database
createdb hotelbooker
```
